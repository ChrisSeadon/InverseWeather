# Inverse Weather (WIP)
A simple application that compares weather in the user's location with the weather at their antipode.

### Tech Stack
- Front-end: Next-js/React
- Back-end: Node.js/Next.js App Router
- Map library: Leaflet JS/Geolocation API for coordinates
- Weather API: OpenWeatherMap
- CSS Framework: Tailwind CSS
- Hosting Platform: Vercel

### TO-DO
- *(In progress)* Implement WikiMedia API for an up-to-date summary of antipodes as a concept
- Polish UI, improve scaling for mobile
- Allow manual entry of location, possibly using something like Google Places API

The application is deployed at: [inverse-weather.vercel.app](https://inverse-weather.vercel.app)
